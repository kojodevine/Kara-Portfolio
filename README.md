# Kara-Portfolio
My name is Kara Deine.  I am a cybersecurity major at Ivy Tech, where I have already earned technical certificates in Criminal Justice and Cybersecurity.  I also have my CompTIA Security + and A+ certifications.  I am hoping to transistion into a position where I am able to use my skills in order to help vulnerable women and children.  I would very much like to get involved in a group that uses my developing skills to track or locate missing and exploited women and children.  I have a day job that I enjoy, so I am very interested in applying myself to something I am passionate about.

I am a member of WiT (women in technology), IWiT (Indiana women in technology), and WiCys (women in cybersecurity.  I think promiting women and girls in any field that they choose is imporant.  One of me and my sisters favorite things to say is, "My dad didn't raise girls, he raised men!" becuase he never let us think we couldn't do something because we were girls, and that's the world I think every girl should be raised in.

I wouldn't count myself as proficient in any language, but I am working very hard on learning Python.  I have done some small projects for classes, but I would like to meet indiiduals that would help me learn to write better.
